### 🧭 What I'm working on

Crafting modern GNU-style tools that hum with parallel breath:

- 🧩 Monadic design — for composable, error-safe flows
- ⚙️ Parallel computation — scaling across cores like spinning echoes  
- 🚀 [Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) — for concurrency, clarity, and speed of invocation

### 💡 A few Open Source projects I like

- [NFStream](https://github.com/nfstream/nfstream) — flexible network data analysis 🔍  
- [ngrep](https://github.com/jpr5/ngrep) — grep for the network layer 🧵  
- [Backbone.js](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone) — structure for JS-heavy apps 🕸️

---

### 🧙‍♂️ Discovery & notable facts

- [YAMLScript](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript) — a functional language written in YAML.  
  _Yes, it’s real. Yes, it’s beautiful._

> I also carry a fair background in [Perl](https://perlmonks.org) programming 🙃  
> It still whispers in my scripts—especially when the logic turns arcane.
